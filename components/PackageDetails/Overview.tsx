      The Mustang Circuit Tour, also known as the Mustang Round Trek, is a classic expedition-style journey through the mystical and remote region of Upper Mustang in Nepal, centered around the ancient kingdom of Lo, with its dramatic landscapes and towering peaks. This challenging trek in western Nepal offers a full adventure and off-the-beaten-path experience in one of the countryâ€™s most unspoiled and culturally rich regions. The Mustang Circuit itinerary traverses serene, isolated terrains filled with natural beauty, crossing high desert plateaus, rugged canyons, and high passes with breathtaking viewpoints. The route provides constant views of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges while passing through ancient walled villages, monasteries, and striking desert landscapes shaped by wind and time. Our 20-day Mustang Circuit Tour is a fully guided and supported trek with camping and guesthouse accommodations throughout. The journey begins with a short flight to Pokhara, followed by a scenic flight to Jomsom the next day. The trek commences from Jomsom, following a carefully crafted itinerary designed to balance adventure, cultural immersion, and acclimatization.
